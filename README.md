# Hey there, I'm Jihad

I'm a regular guy. I'm not special, but a hard worker and a fast learner like most developers. I'm not one of those "genius" developers, but I put my hard work and energy into every line of code I write. I’m experienced in React, Next.js, TypeScript, and modern backend systems, with a strong focus on clean code, performance, and scalable application development.
