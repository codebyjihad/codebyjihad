I'm a regular developer who believes consistency and effort matter more than being a “genius.” I’m a fast learner and a hard worker, and I put care into every line of code I write.
I work with React, Next.js, TypeScript, and modern backend systems, focusing on clean code, performance, and building scalable applications.

### My Current Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React, Next.js, Bootstrap, Sass, Tailwind CSS  
**Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Go  
**Database:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB  
**ORM:** Prisma  
**Infrastructure:** Docker, NGINX, AWS, GitHub Actions (CI/CD)  
**Testing:** Jest, Supertest, React Testing Library  
**Core Strengths:** TypeScript, JavaScript, SQL, Data Structures, Algorithms, OOP
